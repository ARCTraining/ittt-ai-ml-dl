# Techtalks IT: AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Proposal
A 4 session series of TechTalks/ training sessions for IT Colleagues to give a background to ML tools and techniques using a 
realistic example familiar to most, the analysis of IT tickets.

## Suggested dates
* Session 1: Tuesday 19th May 1400-1500
* Session 2: Tuesday 2nd June 1400-1500
* Session 3: Tuesday 16th June 1400-1500
* Session 4: Tuesday 30th June 1400-1500

## Example dataset
https://github.com/karolzak/support-tickets-classification

## Suggested content

Session 1: General introduction to AI/ML/DL, supervised and unsupervised learning; classification and regression and what the terms mean; introduction to the business problem (and some sample data); code along with ScikitLearn and classifying ticket content.

Session 2: Deep dive code-along with classification (getting the ticket to the right team) and regression (can we predict how long a query should take to be answered) problems.

Session 3: Identifying topics in dataset. Code along with LDA; opportnity to discuss approaches eg. bag-of-words

Session 4: Measuring the efficiency of classification (scikit learn again). Neral networks- training a simple LSTM model for classification.
