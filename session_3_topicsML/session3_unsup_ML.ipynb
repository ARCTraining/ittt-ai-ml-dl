    "Text analysis is a classic computational and data science problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "![NLP](https://deeplearninganalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nlp.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared with regression and classification approaches on continuous and categorical dataset taking text data and deriving distinct insights is a far more complicated task. Text data and especially free text (text fields in sentence form) is typically classed as a form of unstructured data because of the various nuances introduced by languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the ever increasing computational power has come a side-by-side improvements in approaches to text analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different approaches to text analysis such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, information retrieval and much more. In this talk we'll focus specifically on **topic modelling**. An unsupervised statistical approach for identifying abstract 'topics' from within a collection of documents (corpus).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look specifically at latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a topic modelling approach developed in [2002](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v3/blei03a.html). LDA has become one of the most commonly used topic modelling approaches and many extensions of LDA have since been proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use financial complaints data from the [US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/#download-the-data) for this example."

The times i would answer the call no one would respond, what would happen is that the line becomes silent and then the phone would hang up. I was a bit curious of the person that could be calling and wondered if it was someone who probably changed their number or probably just an important call and so i decided to dial the number on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX after which a female voice answered and said \" Is this XXXX XXXX '' so i responded and asked \" Who do i have the pleasure of speaking to '' the female voice kept asking if my name is ... ... ... .., to which i responded that it is only mannerly to introduce yourself and say what you are calling about, the person still decided to kept asking me to verify my name, address, and last XXXX digits of my social, I did not verify my social but i gave my name and continued to asked what was the reason for calling but the person kept asking me to verify my address and my SSN to which i did n't. They eventually started to tell me that this is an attempt to collect a debt since XXXX and if i was ever an XXXX customer. they still refused to give me the name of the collection agency they represent and kept saying i owed {$100.00}. I told them sorry they have the wrong person because i never was indebted to a XXXX. However i told the person not to call my phone ever and i will report this call. she ended by saying that this will go to dispute. I can say with all conviction that my credit report does not indicate i owe an XXXX and i am convicted that this is a scam \n",

I further listened to the prompts and then a representative came online say that this was an attempt to collect a debt. I asked the person who said that his name was \" XXXX '' to please send me everything in writing so that I could validate this debt. He then states that he can not do this because I had been contacted before by other collection agencies and had a breach of contract with them and that he was a mediator trying to settle the debt before taking this matter to court. I simply stated that I was at work and that I would have to give him a call back. Before I hung up the phone I asked what was the name of the company that he was calling from and he stated that he was calling from \" XXXX ''. Once I got off of work I tried to do a business search of this company and found nothing. I did a reverse number search and nothing came up except stating thAt this company was a scam and listing all of the numbers associated with the number that had called me. I then proceeded to call back and spoke with a \" XXXX '' no last name. He give me all the legal jumbo saying that we are on a recorded line. I once again asked for validation of the debt in writing and he said that he could only do it if I gave him my banking information and then he would send an email stating that the debt was paid.

      "Caine & Weiner entered into an Independent Contractor Agreement ( Agreement ) with County Medical Services Program Governing Board ( Governing Board ), effective XX/XX/XXXX. The Agreement required Caine & Weiner to promptly undertake the collection of accounts placed with [ Caine & Weiner ] by the Board for purposes of collection, and to use diligence [ in doing so ] ( Agreement, Ex. A, A. ) The Agreement also required Caine & Weiner to use its best effort in providing collection services on all claims assigned for collection. ( Agreement, Ex. A, B1. ) In XX/XX/XXXX, over {$4.00} XXXX in accounts were placed with Caine & Weiner for collection. Caine & Weiner did not make any effort to collect on the accounts in clear breach of the Agreement. In fact, it took until XX/XX/XXXX, nearly six months from when the accounts were initially placed, for Caine & Weiner to inform the Governing Board that they were not going to provide any collection services.\n",

      "Caine & Weiner claims the accounts placed by the Governing Board did not include provider addresses, which allegedly prevented the initiation of collection efforts. However, this argument fails as XXXX XXXX, Chief Operating Officer of Caine & Weiner, acknowledged in an email dated XX/XX/XXXX, that he worked through the first file of accounts and found 1,200 provider addresses using Caine & Weiners own resources. These 1,200 provider addresses account for approximately one third of all accounts placed with Caine & Weiner. In addition, each of the accounts placed with Caine & Weiner contained a National Provider Identifier ( NPI ) number that allows a  provider address to be located by a simple XXXX search. The Governing Board also provided Caine & Weiner with provider addresses for each of the accounts at issue upon learning of their claimed inability to collect on the accounts. \n",
      "Caine & Weiners failure to promptly undertake the collection of accounts constitutes a breach of the Agreement. The Governing Board attempted to resolve this dispute directly with Caine & Weiner through a meet and confer process as set forth in the Agreement. Caine & Weiner participated in a conference call with the Governing Board on XX/XX/XXXX, but has since failed to respond to any subsequent communications. \n",

      "This complaint is regarding a debt of which I XXXX XXXX advised the company PRA Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC. that I would pay a settlement or a portion of the amount owed by my son XXXX XXXX. My son XXXX XXXX gave PRA permissin to speak with me regarding his account. Arrangements were made on XXXX/XXXX/2015 after receiving notification from local law offices that a judgement had been filed against my son however, we never received notification via mail of the judgement from PRA.. In order to to settle the debt which the original amount owed was {$2600.00} however, the settlement I agreed upon was made for total of {$1800.00} a difference of {$800.00} taken off the original balance. The agreement made included giving PRA permission to debit my checking account beginning XXXX/XXXX/2015 in bi weekly in the amount of XXXX to conclude when the total balance of {$1800.00} was paid off. I requested documentation of the settlement agreement with the current settlement balance owed on several occasions XXXX/XXXX/2015 and again on XXXX/XXXX/2015 speaking to several representatives who all told me they would not provide me with a letter outlining the agreement. XXXX representative told me on XXXX/XXXX/2015 that PRA \" did not put the current settlement balance on documentation just in case a consumer defaulted on the payment agreement then they could go back and recoup the original amount so they just left the original balance on all documentation. \" I requested this documentation be placed in writing based on the companies past track record of unethical businesses practices under the FDCPA including continued collection on debt paid or not owed. Again after spending two hours on the phone I was not able to get the agreement in writing. I called the FTC regarding the issue and thus filed a complaint. I put the company on notice that I was filing a complaint with CFPB and I would be placing this in writing via certified mail that due to their refusal to give me something in writing of the settlement agreement and current balance owed that they were to cease debiting my checking account. I advised that once I received the written notice of the agreement that I would resume payments as agreed. XXXX XXXX should have been notified of any or all legal actions by PRA prior to this company filing judgement thus, giving him an opportunity to clear up the debt however, proper notification was not made to him. \n",

The representative, XXXX told me that there was nothing in their file that she can find with my signature. So she emailed me a loan modification without a signature. I told them that is illegal because I did not authorize XXXX or any lender to do a loan modification for me. I called XXXX myself and spoke with XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX. She confirmed that there was no loan modification done. She also said that my account was sold to Nationstar in XX/XX/XXXX, which is now called, Mr. Cooper. I called Mr. Cooper again and asked to speak with a manager. Following day, the manager, XXXX XXXX called me which I told her the same thing. We had the same discussion and I told her that if they can't provide loan modification docs with my signature, then they have to get rid of it. I made it clear with her that I need this issue cleared soonest possible because I need to apply for cash out refinancing to pay my debts while the rate is still low. Then I found the letter from XXXX in my file proving that there was no loan modification ever done. So I emailed it to XXXX. Today, she called me again without a solution and telling me again that they are searching for loan modification docs. I said to her that they won't find anything since there was no loan modification ever done and I already emailed her the letter from XXXX proving that there was no loan modification ever done. She confirmed that she have received it and that she showed it to her supervisors. XXXX said she'll get back with me again.

The customer service representative at that time said I needed to consolidate my current loans with my current lender at the time ( XXXX  ) in order to have them qualify for the PSLF program through XXXX XXXX XXXX. \n",
      "I then called my current lender at the time and started the process of consolidating my Direct Stafford loans and they were officially consolidated on XX/XX/XXXX. \n",
      "I then reapplied for the PSLF program and was accepted. My loans were officially transferred to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. \n",
      "At this time I had already been working for a XXXX job for six years and had been in repayment status for my student loans. All those qualifying payments over those six years should have been applied to my PSLF repayment schedule. \n",
      "I then received an email in XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX stating that I could view the amount of qualifying payments that were applied to my PSLF over the course of the last year. When I went to check I expected to see an accumulation of 7 years of payments, but there were only the payments I had made since my loans had officially transferred to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX.\n",

      "I then called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to see why there were not more payments applied to my running balance for the PSLF and I was informed by a customer representative from XXXX XXXX that when I consolidated my loans prior to transferring them to XXXX XXXX that it null and voided any previous payments I had made on those loans. \n",
      "I was extremely upset, because the only reason I applied for the PSLF program is because I knew I had 6 years of payments that would set me up well to have my loans paid off in the 10 years or 120 payments whichever came first. If I would of known that consolidating my loans would null all those qualifying payments I WOULD OF NEVER DONE THAT. No one from XXXX  educated me on this crucial point. \n",
      "I then spoke to another representative from XXXX XXXX on that same day because I could not wrap my head around why I was told to consolidate when this would start me completely over on my repayment. I was then told directly from the customer service representative on XX/XX/XXXX that I was misinformed from XXXX XXXX and wrongly sent a denial letter that stated my loans were not eligible when in fact my Direct Stafford loans were eligible for the program and they did not need to be consolidated prior to transferring. \n",
      "I am seeking to have this fixed and to have my payments that I made over those six years prior to being told I had to consolidate applied to my running balance of my payments for my PSLF. \n",
      "This whole situation makes XXXX XXXX look extremely devious and further enforces the stigma around the PSLF program and why people are so frustrated with the process. \n",
      "I have attached official documents from XXXX, showing my loans prior to consolidation and documents showing the consolidation process and the denial letter from XXXX XXXX. \n",

      "XXXX originated as the third party on this account and continuously put us in payment plan that had no end in sight. We continued to struggle make payments for the past 15 years, but made all our payments except only had to take a forbearance once due to a job loss. We struggled without savings and without retirement knowing we were getting close to the 20 year forbearance. Now our loans are with Navient and things are not any better. When we called recently to find out exactly how many more years we had to pay until our loans were forgiven, they said \" oh you are not eligible for forgiveness because you are not enrolled in that program. We can enroll you in that program now if you like, and in 20 years you will have forgiveness as long as you are in good standing. '' Not only do we face 20 more years of payments, and no more savings, or retirement, but our kids are now faced with taking loans for school and more. The cycle never ends with the deceptive practices. Never once did we assume our loans would not be forgiven after 20 years of payments, and especially since the principal amount of the loans has been paid, but due to the way the system works the wording and the structure of their repayment assistance you never payoff your loans and you keep paying more and more interest. We are now faced with our payments going from {$650.00} to over {$900.00} for the next 20 years, even though we have paid over {$110000.00} to date, which was the amount of our original loans. According to Navient we will now pay the same amount in interest as we had in original loans, and we will have done so over 40 years. This practice is unfair for those who have made payments for decades and continue to do so, only to find out that our remaining loans would not be forgiven after 20 years. Never were we advised about having to be in a special program for forgiveness after 20 years, actually the only willingness the groups are readily able to do is lower your payment, but never telling you the long term ramifications. This is worse than the housing market scams, I am not looking for any special penalties or refunds, or monetary damage. At this point I would like to just have my the remainder of my loans forgiven. That is only fair. I have paid over the original loan amount since I started paying, but apparently that only goes to interest. Doing simple math even though we paid more that this, we owed {$110000.00} originally, and we paid about {$600.00} per month for 15-17 years at least. This means we have paid around {$120000.00} to these companies. Somehow the principal has never gone down ... it actually went up ... and we wo n't be forgiven once we even reach 20 years. I have paid and been responsible for paying back the monies, and only to find out I have been stabbed in the back. Once again I do not seek damages, but just forgiveness for the remainder of my loans as I assumed would happen at the 20 year mark anyways. I ask for forgiveness now please, before I am forced to make even more Ludacris $ 900+ monthly payments. \n",

      "Freedom Mortgage bought my account from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   several months ago and it has been nothing but a debacle since they started servicing the loan. This complaint is specific to how they are setting up bi-weekly auto payments ( not how they keep calling me to refinance even though I've requested no more calls ). Over the last 4 months they have had to reverse and reapply payments 6 times due to their errors and now I can't keep up with what is accurate. A major UDAAP concern because at this point I'm completely lost and so are the agents that I speak with. \n",
      "\n",
      "Summary of events : XXXX XXXXXXXX - I set up bi-weekly payments. In order to do this I had to pay my loan ahead by one month which I did. I used the system to set up the bi-weekly payments, but it was very confusing because it does not clearly state what they payment amount will be. I called customer service and they informed me that I have to act as if it is a bi-monthly payment and double the amount of what I actually want coming out bi-weekly ( confusing, right? ). For example, I want to pay exactly {$2000.00} every Monday after I get paid ( bi-weekly ). In order to do this, I have to put in the system that I want my payment amount to be {$4000.00}. In a nutshell, I have to put a monthly amount that will be calculated bi-monthly, but taken out bi-weekly. Confusing, but I was fine with it and the agent was actually very helpful. \n",
      "\n",
      "XXXX XXXX - I noticed that my first 'new ' bi-weekly auto-draft was the same amount as the old monthly auto-draft ( should have been {$2000.00}, but it was {$1900.00} ). I then noticed that there was no difference in the breakdown of how principle, interest or escrow were being applied. I called customer service and they explained to me that the first payment of the month should cover the actual payment and then the second or third payment will be principle only. I asked why the first payment didn't take half of the payment amount, apply the rest to principle and then take the second payment to cover the rest. Obviously, any time there is a third payment it should go to principle only. She informed me that I could set it up this way and that it could save interest, but that they would have to put in a ticket and manually set it up. She said that this would have to be a 'special request ' which I found odd, but didn't question it. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few days later - I called customer service again because they reversed and replied the payment, but the actual breakdown of what money was applied to principle, interest and escrow was not on the website. I again explained the whole scenario over again and several \" tickets '' were put in the system to 'fix ' the issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "About a week later - I check my account and notice that payment of roughly {$1400.00} was applied to the account ( I have no earthly idea where this {$1400.00} number came from ). It was broken out into {$970.00} for \" Payment '' and {$510.00} for \" Principle Payment ''. I called customer service once again and immediately asked for a manager. I was informed that no manager was available to speak to me but that they could send me over to the escalation unit. I spoke with \" XXXX '' for about 50 minutes explaining the whole scenario once again clearly articulating that I want {$2000.00} drafted from my account on a bi-weekly basis on the Monday after I get paid. At this point, I actually felt pretty good that the issues were going to be resolved. XXXX put in more tickets and seemed to be helpful. XXXX did confirm that the way the initial bi-weekly auto draft was set up incorrectly. We went over the summary multiple times which was the following : - {$2000.00} to be draft bi-weekly - {$970.00} of that payment will go to the monthly payment ( to cover principle, interest & escrow ) - The additional {$1000.00} will go to principle only Lastly, I was informed that I should go ahead and plan on calling in or checking my account on XX/XX/XXXX which should be a principle only payment. The agent was not confident that the system would allocate funds correctly. \n",

      "Today ( XX/XX/18 ) - I go look at my account and I immediately notice two things.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The \" Principle Payment '' of {$510.00} was reversed and reapplied as \" Payment ''.\n",

      "Ok. The issue is that this company has not been charging the amount of interest monthly that it was agreed since the beggining of the loan back in XXXX when it began, so the total amount for the loan was originally for {$27000.00} for a total amount of 72 months at an interest rate of 13.55 %. and I had paid {>= $1,000,000} in total payments and they say that I still so up till this day the say I own {$7000.00} cents, and that I have 14 payments left from a total of 72 payments, from which I had made according to them 58 payments, which is not including the extra {$5100.00} only for principal payments that I had sent to them in separate checks besides my montly payments so that my remaining principal balance can go down, from before doing this extra payments I made sure I called them and I spoke on the phone with the representative and make them assure me that the extra cash payment ( besides my montly payment included on the side ) was only going to go to the remaining principal balance from the car, and they always agreed on the phone that it was all going to go for the remaining balance since I was also paying the monthly loan amount for that time with the interest they charge separate, it was not until later I went and I check my account and I saw that they always took certain amount from my lump sum payments that we agreed on was only to go for principal so when I called to dispute this with them they say that they were sorry for that error and they were going to send a message to the head department and get back at me, which they never did, then I called back again and still, they told me that they charged the interest for the payment in advance for my next payments, so I was like what!!! so I told them basically the do whatever they decide and do whatever they think is the interest or fee charging me for the month. I had noted that they charged back in XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX AND XX/XX/XXXX, more than two months just the entire amount agreed monthly of {$550.00}, THE ENTIRE AMOUNT WAS PUT TO FINANCE CHARGES ONLY AND NOTHING, NOTHING TO MY MONTHLY PRINCIPAL BALANCE!

THEN I MADE BACK IN XX/XX/XXXX A PAYMENT ON {$2500.00}, I HAD SENT TWO SEAPARATE CHECKS ONE FOR {$2000.00} AND ONE FOR THE MONTHLY PAYMENT {$550.00} AND I HAD TOLD THEM AHEAD OF TIME THAT THE {$2000.00} WAS FOR PRINICIPAL ONLY, LIKE THE ALSO ANOTHE TWO MORE LUMP AMOUNT PAYMENTS OF {$2000.00} IN THIS PAST XX/XX/XXXX AND OF {$1100.00} ON XX/XX/XXXX AND ALSO I HAD PAID THE MONTLY AMOUNT FOR THSI REASON THEY WONT TAKE ANY MONEY FROM MY LUMP PAYMENT AND MY REMAINING PRINCIPAL BALANCE WILL GO DOWN AND IT DIDNT BECASUE THEY TOOK {$290.00} FROM THE {$2000.00} AND ONLY PUT TO MY REMAINING BALANCE A TOTAL OF {$1700.00} AND FORM THE {$1100.00}. XXXX CHECK THEY ALSO TOOK FROM THERE THE AMOUNT OF {$260.00} CENTS PUTTING ONLY {$830.00} TO MY REMANING BALANCE, BESIDES ME MAKING AND ALREADY PAYING FOR MY MONTHLY PAYMENT AND THE SUBSEQUENT INTEREST THEY CHARGE MONTHLY. PLEASE BE AWARE ALL THIS WAS DONE IN THE SAME PAST MONTH OF XXXX AND CALLED A FEW TIMES ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THEY DIDNT RESOLVE IT AND SAID THAT THEY WERE SORRY FOR THAT AND THEY WERE GOING TO FIX IT AND GET BACK AT ME, AND IM STILL WAITING, ALSO I HAD TOLD THEM THAT I NEEDED THEM TO MAIL ME A FULL STATEMENT OF MY MONTHLY PAYMENTS SINCE BEGGINIGN AND GIVING ME RUN AROUDN THEN WHEN I WENT ONLINE I COULDNT ACCESS MY ACCOUNT IN LIKE 2 DAYS AND I WAS NEVER ABLE TO SEE THE SPLIT FEES THEY WERE ALWAYS CHARGING BECAUSE EVERTIME THE SEND ME A PAPER STATEMENT NOTIFICATION OR I WENT ONLINE I WAS NEVER ABLE TO SEE HOW MUCH OF MY MONTHLY AMOUNT I WAS PAYING FOR FINANCE AND PRINCIPAL, THEY NEVER SEND AN ENTIRE DISPLAY OF THE SPLITTING OF HOW MUCH FINANCE I WAS BEING CHARGED PER THAT MONTH ( WHICH THEY CHANGED CONSTANTLY EVERY MONTH THEY DID, IT WAS NEVER A SPECIFIC AMOUNT IT WENT FORM AS LOW AS {$86.00} MONTH TO CHARGING THE ENTIRE MONTLHY AMOUNT OF {$550.00} ONLY TO FINANCE, NOTHING TO PRINCIPAL!!!!!

      "We have a credit card with Discover. We make our minimum payments on time and as a way to pay down our balance sooner, we have been making extra payments. Typically these extra payments were being made on a weekly to bi-weekly basis. The amounts of these extra payments were anywhere from {$5.00} - {$50.00}. We made a payment of {$350.00} recently. That amount covered what I used to purchase things plus extra. Upon checking my account, I noticed that our balance had increased instead of decreasing, so I called. I was told that according to my user agreement, Discover confiscates extra payments and applies them to the minimum balance of the following month due to how 'our billing cycle ' is set up. I called again, got the same answer. I emailed them, and again, they insist that they are going to confiscate these extra payments unless they are paid before the XXXX of each month. Today ( XXXX XXXX ) I called the exec office of Discover. The first person I spoke with hung up on me and the second person gave me the same story about how we agreed to all of this and it has always been that way. Since I do not have a copy of the 2011 Discover user agreement, I ca n't honestly say whether it has 'always been this way ' or not. Basically what Discover is saying is that none of their card holders can be trusted to pay their bills even if Discover has not justifiable reason for treating their customers this way including us. I have read all of Discover 's disclosure pages posted here as well their website and even checked the Federal Reserve 's disclosure page. None of these pages explain this confiscation policy that Discover talks about. If this what users are agreeing to, why is this not posted on their website? People should know how ( or in this case IF ) their money is being applied to their balance. right? \n",
      "\n",
      "In order to make these extra payments work as intended, a customer has to XXXX of XXXX things. A ) Pay the extra within the window that it wo n't be confiscated or B ) Pay extra on their minimum payment. Option A pays down balance. Option B may or may not pay down a balance depending on how much is paid. The only way to decrease the balance with Option B would be to pay the minimum plus the interest, plus whatever the extra would be. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Discover is so concerned with minimum payments being made, one would be lead to believe that they would appreciate any extra money that was sent their way. That seems not to be the case. Instead, if a card holder does not know about this confiscation policy, they make not progress paying off their balance if they make the minimum payment with no extra. Sounds like a good money making deal for Discover if I 've ever heard one. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have a copy of the Discover user agreement being sent to me. According to their website it will take XXXX30 days to get here. Not that it matters at this point as now I know what the game is. Pay extra in the 5 day window along with the regular minimum payment plus interest. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do n't expect anything to become of this complaint, but I do think Discover customers who do pay their bills and send extra payments should know what they are getting into. As mentioned previously, since Discover feels that strongly about this policy, it should be posted in all of their disclosure pages and on their page that explains how payments are applied which includes the extra ones. If they do n't want to post it there, it should be printed on billing statements as there is no mention of this policy there either. All it mentions is paying down higher interest rate balances first. No mention of confiscation of extra payments.. \n",

      "On Thursday, XXXX XXXX, 2014, I walked into the XXXX branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA to make a withdrawal from my checking account. I withdrew {$2000.00} from my account and planned to use the branch 's ATM to deposit {$700.00} in funds to my Bank of America account. XXXX of the reasons I changed my checking account to a XXXX XXXX Account was to do this very thing, but still, I confirmed with the teller that I could do this at their ATM. She confirmed that I could. I walked over to the drive-up ATM and began the deposit with my Bank of America card. The machine accepted my card and pin number and then displayed my various Bank of America accounts. I choose my checking account then inserted {$700.00} cash into the ATM. This is where the problem began. The ATM gave me an error message : \" This transaction request is not supported by your card, please take your cash. '' Then the machine froze. The ATM did not return my money or provide me with a receipt, and I was unable to do anything further to complete the transaction. I immediately called XXXX Bank, a customer service representative instructed me to go inside the branch to report the issue. The teller walked out and saw that the ATM was frozen, but she informed me that the machine was not serviced at the branch and that I 'd have to contact Bank of America. I did and for the rest of the afternoon went back and forth between Bank of America and XXXX trying to determine what could be done. Between myself, the XXXX branch teller, the XXXX ATM Services department and the Bank of America Disputes Department, it was determined that there had been an issue, and that I was to go back to the branch the next day to file a claim with the branch manager. \n",
      "I returned on Friday morning, XXXX XXXX, 2014 to file the claim through the branch manager, XXXX XXXX. I was told by the same teller that XXXX XXXX was n't available and that he XXXX XXXX was unsure of how to even how to help me. Eventually, I was given a dispute number, but I later learned it did not represent a claim that the branch was filing for me. After I had left the bank, XXXX XXXX approached me in the parking lot to inform me that XXXX would be denying the claim. Overall, I found his demeanor uncooperative, his attitude intimidating, and his behavior simply unprofessional and untrustworthy. I continued, without XXXX XXXX 's assistance, through XXXX 's and Bank of America 's claims and escalation procedures. Phone records show that I communicated with XXXX Bank Services and Bank of America at the time of the incident, and surely there is video of me at the teller, at the ATM and a record that {$700.00} was deposited in that ATM or its cash deposits were {$700.00} over. I have tried to follow both Bank of America 's and XXXX Bank 's processes but they each just blame each other. XXXX most recently sent me an email saying that \" Bank of America should have researched the situation thoroughly on my behalf as an account holder and potentially offered to return the funds ''. Neither bank wants to take responsibility and I 'm stuck in the middle of their tug-of-war. My deposit was {$700.00} and I 'm finding myself having to work around not having these funds. I attempted an allowable ATM transaction, I saw my BOA accounts on the screen but the ATM kept my money and did n't register the deposit into my BOA account or provide me with a deposit slip. I 'm a customer for both banks and they have an obligation to protect their customer 's funds while I 'm transacting with them. \n",
      "I 've attached photos of the ATM error message, the email that XXXX sent, indicating that it fell to BOA to return my funds. I 've also included a copy of Bank of America 's documentation that there was no transaction completed on that day. \n",

      "XXXX is a Complaint I already have with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in regard to Lender America 's Wholesale Lender, Servicer Bank of America, Trustee XXXX fka XXXX Trustee for XXXX, XXXX Asset Backed Certificates Series XXXX. Today XX/XX/XXXX I have received another letter from Bank of America requesting more time to investigate Account XXXX. Bank of America ( Servicer ) claims to have Legal Standing to foreclose on property @ XXXX. America 's Wholesale Lender ( A Fictitious Corporation ) A Service Mark Name filed with the United States Trademark Registry ( Trademark Assignment ) Number XXXX never had lawful standing to convey property or sell property yet on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX through an Assignment of Deed of Trust conveyed property over to XXXX violating a Pooling and Service Agreement as the Assignment of Deed of Trust was to be in the pool prior to it closing XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America XXXX then took action to foreclose on property knowing that America 's Wholesale Lender was not a Corporation and Bank XXXX New York XXXX as Trustee who had no lawful say in the property whatsoever foreclosed on property on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and sold property to XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX through a foreclosure sale. XXXX XXXX took me to Eviction Court on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Justice of the Peace, Precinct XXXX Place XXXX, Judge XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, PH : XXXX Case No. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX vs XXXX XXXX. The judge did not evict me from the property and had me pay a {$1500.00} Cash Bond to appeal in a Higher Court. I am waiting on the Court Date and Court to which the appeal will be heard. XXXX XXXX stated that the property was valued at {$110000.00} and presented a Deed without Warranty to the court shows that XXXX fka The XXXX as Trustee for Certificateholders XXXX, XXXX Series XXXX for sume {$10.00} was paid and my property was sold. XXXX put in writing to me a several occassions they did not Own Loan or property was not a lender and had no say in the property yet Bank XXXX New York XXXX sold the property. After giving Bank of America and XXXX fka XXXX 5 years to provide me with who the true lender of the property XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was, both parties declined to be honest and truthful. They used deceptive acts to take control of the property and foreclose for their own personal gain. In my opinion, this is why I have the opportunity to Appeal to a higher court. America 's Wholesale Lender and XXXX as Trademark/Service Mark/Fictitious entities is the reason I gave the judge and told her that XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, # XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX does not have a clean title to the property just as from Origination of the Deed of Trust and Promissory Note in the name of America 's Wholesale Lender was deceptive and it is not clear who the Lender is or who the debt is owed. From what I can see, I am the holder of the Deed of Trust to the Note which reads Lender is America 's Wholesale Lender. I am still living in the property for alleged XXXX under the fictitious Lender. Bank of America sold the property and is going to be held liable for damages. \n",
