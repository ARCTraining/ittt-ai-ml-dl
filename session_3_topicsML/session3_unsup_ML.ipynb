    "\n",
    "Text analysis is a classic computational and data science problem, \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared with regression and classification approaches on continuous and categorical dataset taking text data and deriving distinct insights is a far more complicated task. Text data and especially free text (text fields in sentence form) is typically classed as a form of unstructured data because of the various nuances introduced by languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the ever increasing computational power has come a side-by-side improvements in approaches to text analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of topic modelling, identifying abstract 'topics' within a collection of documents (corpus) using statistical models, was first described in 1998, with probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) outlined in 1999 and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) developed in [2002](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v3/blei03a.html). LDA has become one of the most commonly used topic modelling approaches since although many extensions of LDA have since been proposed."
