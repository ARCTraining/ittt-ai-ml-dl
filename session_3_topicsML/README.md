# Session 3: Unsupervised machine learning approaches - latent Dirichlet allocation

This is the readme for code for session 3 of the Research Computing IT TechTalk series focusing on machine learning, artificial intelligence and deep learning.

Session 3 will cover an example of unsupervised machine learning, specifically looking at latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a form of dimensionality reduction commonly used in text analysis to cluster together text into unobserved groups.
